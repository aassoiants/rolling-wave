The Rolling Insights product department is an incubator that is part of larger consultancy called Rolling Wave. Rolling Insights wants to make access to meaningful sports data easy to use for everyone. Rolling Insights offers two products: SportWise and DataFeeds. Use cases for these products include fantasy leagues, sports betting, and meeting the needs of sports superfans.

Rolling Insights sought the help of SAITâ€™s 2023 Q1 Bootcamp students (UX, Development, and Product Management) to work on its DataSpaces feature. The client determined DataSpaces as a top priority through user interviews. 

DataSpaces are created by expert users (Owners), made up of sport data columns and custom mathematical data fields. DataSpaces are published on a marketplace for other platform users to view, follow, and leverage as a starting point. 

The project runs from Thu Feb 23, 2023 until the final presentation on Thu Apr 6, 2023.
